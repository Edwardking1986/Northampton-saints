					Saints 24 - Exter 31
					The Saints were well beaten at Sandy Park after a relentless display from the title chasing Chiefs.</h2>
					
					<p class="card_para"> Already missing the likes of Stephen Myler, George North and Louis Picamoles, the Saints lost skipper Tom Wood as a late injury withdrawal before kick off and Courtney Lawes shortly into a draining first half on the defensive in the South West.

					While JJ Hanrahan's early score kept things close at the turnaround, the home side continued to dominate proceedings and chalked up six tries to coast clear in the second half, meaning the Saints' Champions Cup hopes will come down to a final day showdown with Harlequins at Franklin's Gardens next Saturday.</p>

				SAINTS SIGN SUPER RUGBY PROP

				Northampton Saints has today announced the signing of Western Force prop Francois van Wyk for the 2017/18 season.
				</h2>

				<p class="card_para">
				The 25-year-old loose head is South African-born and represented his hometown club Western Province having come through the academy setup in Cape Town.

				Also educated at the University of Cape Town, van Wyk made the switch to Perth in 2014 and has played 12 times for the Force in Super Rugby, providing a powerful presence with his 17st 13lb frame.

				“We’ve been impressed with what we’ve seen from Francois in Super Rugby over the past couple of seasons,” director of rugby Jim Mallinder commented. “He’s a strong scrummager and still relatively young for a front row forward.

				Each of the dozen players ending their time as Saints at the end of the season received a framed match shirt after the last regular game of the Aviva Premiership season on Saturday, after completing a lap of the pitch in front of supporters at Franklin’s Gardens.

				Director of rugby Jim Mallinder paid tribute to the players leaving the club.

				“Many of the players who are leaving have played significant parts in what has been a successful decade for us, with senior players like George, Calum and Lee helping us win the Challenge Cup and Aviva Premiership final in 2014,” he said.

				<p class="card_para" id="collapse">Northampton Saints' side reached the quarter-final of this year's Bury St Edmunds Sevens yesterday after two convincing pool stage wins but Saints fell out of the competitive tournament in the first knock-out round.
				With a group of Saints senior players teaming up with Senior Academy youngsters for the first Sevens competition of the year, Saints stormed to their first victory of the tournament, beating Exiles 40-7 in the first game. Tries from Will Allman, Fraser Strachan and double scores from Tom Collins and Alex Mitchell securing them the win.

				Next Saints faced the Marauders and again posted a win. This time racking up a 36-14 win over their opponents in another try fest. </p>

					<p class="card_para">The Saints' Champions Cup hopes now rest on a favourable result in the Challenge Cup final and a playoff, despite victory in a tense showdown with Harlequins at the Gardens. 

					The home side required four match points more than the Londoners to sneak into sixth place and seal automatic qualification, but come the final whistle the three-try, two-point margin was not enough and the visitors celebrated in defeat.

					Saints got off to the worst possible start. A clearance from the kickoff went out on the full and having marched some 40 metres back upfield for a lineout, Quins then went through the phases close to the home line, where James Horwill finally broke the Saints’ resolve.</p>

				<p class="card_para">Despite earning a 22-20 win over Harlequins in the last regular game of the Aviva Premiership season yesterday, Saints now have to wait for the results of the European Challenge Cup Final next weekend to see if they have a chance of securing European Champions Cup rugby next season.
				Courtney Lawes said that while the situation is a tough one for Saints the side will stick together and handle whatever comes their way as a squad.

				“It’s obviously tough to come seventh,” Lawes said after yesterday’s game.

				“It’s tough after having so many opportunities this season to do better but it is what it is now and we need to just stick together, see what happens next weekend and go from there.</p>
