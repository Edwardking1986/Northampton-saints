	  					Luther Burrell joined the Saints from Sale Sharks in 2012 and rapidly made an impression. A powerful centre, Luther was born in Huddersfield and represented his hometown club Huddersfield Giants in rugby league at age grade level before making the switch to rugby union.

						His professional rugby union career began at Leeds Carnegie in 2009 before he joined Sale Sharks in 2011.

						Burrell first represented England in a non-cap match against the CONSUR XV on England’s tour to Argentina in the summer of 2013. He was then called up to the England squad for the 2014 Six Nations after impressive performances for the Saints and made an immediate impression.

						He scored a try for England on his international debut against France and subsequently scored against Scotland and Wales during that same Championship. His 2014 season was capped off with a place on England’s summer tour to New Zealand.

						Burrell has earned 15 England caps so far and was a key member of the Saints squad that won the Aviva Premiership in 2014.

						In May 2016, Luther was recalled to the England squad for their summer Test against Wales at Twickenham. Following his try-scoring antics against Wales, Burrell travelled to Australia for England's summer tour, playing in the first Test in Brisbane as England secured an historic 3-0 Test series win over the Wallabies.

					Before joining the Saints in 2008, Day had spent the entirety of his professional career with the north west club, apart from a short spell at French side Stade Français during the 2007/08 season. 

					Since joining the Saints, Day has been a vital member of the pack, proving incredibly influential at the set piece.

					In 2014 Day was involved in both of the Saints’ cup-winning finals having also played in the European Challenge Cup final in 2009, and the finals of the 2011 Heineken Cup and 2012 LV=Cup. Along with his Saints team mate Ben Foden, his participation in the 2014 Premiership final was the second time Day had won the Premiership. He was a substitute for Sale, alongside Ben, as they beat Leicester in 2006.

					Day's efforts as a member of the double-winning squad in 2013/14 were rewarded as he was named the Players’ Player of the Season.

					At international level, Day has represented England Schools, England Under-19s and England Saxons and he also captained the England Under-21s. Outside of his playing career Day is the chairman of the Rugby Players’ Association, a role he has held since 2014.

					A product of the Saints Academy, 2011 also saw Elliott mark his first Premiership start with a try-scoring appearance in an important away win against Sale Sharks.

					Since then Elliott has become a regular starter on the wing for the Saints with a nose for the try line that simply cannot be taught. He has found himself regularly on the score sheet for the Saints and was awarded Young Player of the Season, as well as top try scorer, for 2012/13. That season saw him score a run of 10 tries in 12 league matches.

					Elliott didn’t take long to make his mark in 2013/14 either, scoring the Saints’ and the Aviva Premiership’s Try of the Season at Gloucester in stunning fashion.

					Internationally, Elliott represented England at Under-18 level and continued his Saints’ try scoring form into England’s Under-20 Six Nations-winning campaign in 2011 before injury disrupted the remainder of his season.

				 	Whilst his showbiz status has grabbed plenty of column inches in recent years, it is testament to Ben Foden’s focus that when he steps onto a rugby pitch he remains one of Europe’s most potent counter-attacking full backs.

					Educated at Bishop Heber High School and Bromsgrove School, Foden's professional career started at Sale Sharks in 2004, and he was a replacement in Sale Sharks’ 2006 Premiership final victory over Leicester Tigers.

					He joined the Saints in 2008 with aspirations of establishing himself at scrum half. However, Foden subsequently impressed at full back, with a string of impressive performances in the 15 jersey. As a result, it is not known if Philippe Saint-André, Foden's coach at Sale Sharks, stuck to his words and ate his French beret!

					Foden has since become a regular at full back in the Saints starting XV. In his first season at the Saints, the full back helped the club win the 2009 European Challenge Cup and played a major role in the double cup-winning side of 2014, scoring a try in the Aviva Premiership final against Saracens. In doing so, he became only the second player after Lewis Moody to score in two consecutive Premiership finals.

					At international level Foden represented England at Under-16s, Under-19s and Under-21s before representing the England Saxons at the 2008 Churchill Cup.

					Foden made his full England debut as a replacement scrum half in the 2009 Six Nations against Italy at Twickenham before playing in a non-capped match against the Barbarians in May 2009. In 2010 he became a regular in the England side and was part of England’s squad at the 2011 Rugby World Cup, scoring tries against Romania and France.

					In total, Foden has played 34 Tests for England, scoring seven tries. Interestingly, Foden has played against France four times during his international career, scoring a try on each occasion.

					Hitting his 200th cap for Saints in the 2016/17 season, Foden has become somewhat of a stalwart of the club though has recently been pushing his younger opposition for a spot on the wing.

					Gibson's professional rugby career began at London Irish in 2009 during which time he received his first call up to the senior England squad for their summer tour to South Africa in 2012. Jamie played in both matches against the SA Barbarians.

					Gibson spent five seasons playing at the Berkshire club before moving to Leicester Tigers in 2013, where he became a regular in the side almost immediately.

					Gibson made an immediate impression when he joined the Saints in 2015, with strong performances seeing him win the Saints’ Player of the Month award for October 2015. In 2015/16 he played a total of 1435 minutes of Premiership rugby, third only to Luther Burrell and Ben Foden.

					Prior to his call up to the full England squad in 2012, Gibson had won the Grand Slam with England Under-18s in 2008 before representing England at Under-20 level at the 2010 Junior World Championship.

					In 2011, Gibson was a member of the England Saxons squad that won the Churchill Cup and he was also named in the squad again in January 2012. He played for England in the 2014 non-cap match against the Barbarians at Twickenham.

						A winner of the Varsity Cup with UCT in 2011, Groom joined Western Province before being called up to the Stormers in 2011 to replace the injured Dewaldt Duvenhage and Ricky Januarie. Over the following 18 months he impressed for Western Province, winning the Currie Cup in 2012 and reaching the final the following year.

						Nic won the Currie Cup for the second time in 2012 as Western Province beat the Golden Lions, a year in which he also helped Western Province win the Vodacom Cup. During his time with the Stormers, Nic made over 50 appearances for the side, becoming a regular in the starting XV in 2014 and 2015.

						Having captained Western Province in the Currie Cup, Nic has a vast amount of playing experience that he will bring to the Gardens this season. Having played with and against some of the world’s best players his experience will be invaluable as he competes for the number nine jersey alongside Lee Dickson and Tom Kessell.

						In the summer of 2016, Nic played for South Africa 'A' against England Saxons in matches that saw him come up against his future Saints team mate Kieran Brookes and defence coach Alan Dickens.

				 	The 2015/16 season was undoubtedly the best season yet for Teimana Harrison. New Zealand-born Harrison became a regular starter for Jim Mallinder’s side, with his impressive performances also earning him a call up to Eddie Jones’ squad for England’s summer tour to Australia. 

					The powerful number eight’s impressive season culminated in him scooping Breakthrough Player, Supporters’ Player and Players’ Player at the Saints' End of Season awards in addition to two Steffans Player of the Month awards and an Aviva Premiership Player of the Month award.

					Born in Opotiki on New Zealand’s North Island, Harrison was scouted by Dylan Hartley when the England hooker visited his old school, Rotorua Boys’ High School, during the 2011 Rugby World Cup. Harrison also captained Rotorua Boys’ High School, with his headmaster once describing his style of play as “mongrel”. One of New Zealand’s leading rugby schools, alumni include All Blacks Liam Messam and Craig Newby.

					Harrison first joined the Saints as a member of the Senior Academy in late 2011 before making the transition into the first team in 2012. His debut for the first team came against Wasps later that year.

					Hartley’s inkling that Harrison was a special player proved correct and since his arrival in the East Midlands the dogged and tenacious back row has become one of the Premiership’s most dangerous ball carriers.

					In May 2016, Harrison received his first call up to the England Senior side, making his debut against Wales at Twickenham. He was subsequently named in England's squad to tour Australia, starting the third and final Test in Sydney as England won their first ever Test series on Australian soil.

					Harrison was also a part of the England squad for the 2017 Six Nations and helped the country become champions for the second year running alongside fellow Saints Courtney Lawes, Dylan Hartley and Tom Wood.

				 	Dylan Hartley is regarded as one of the finest exponents of hooker play in the country, and for good reason. Not only was he captain of the Saints during a successful five-year period, but he spearheaded a pack that destroyed opponents in the Aviva Premiership and European Cup.

					Born in Rotorua, New Zealand, Hartley moved to Crowborough, East Sussex in 2002 where he played rugby for local teams.

					Hartley's professional rugby career began when he joined the Worcester Warriors academy before joining the Saints Senior Academy in the summer of 2005.

					During his time at the Saints Hartley has helped his club return to the Premiership, and captained the club to the 2011 Heineken Cup final and 2013 Aviva Premiership final.

					The following year saw the Saints win both the Aviva Premiership and European Challenge Cup with Hartley club captain once again as the Saints were victorious in both finals.

					Hartley's performances for the Saints have also led to him earning considerable international experience too. In 2005 he represented England at the Under-21 Rugby World Championship in Argentina.

					In 2007 Hartley made his debut for the England Saxons before receiving his first cap for England the following year against the Pacific Islanders at Twickenham. His first Test start came at Old Trafford in 2009 when England played Argentina.

					Hartley was a member of the England squad for the 2011 Rugby World Cup, having also been a part of the England side that won the Six Nations earlier that year.

					In January 2016 Hartley was appointed England captain by new head coach Eddie Jones and just two months later he led England to a first Grand Slam in 13 years after England beat France in Paris.

					After a successful Six Nations campaign Hartley went on to lead England to an historic Test series victory over Australia. England won all three Tests against the Wallabies and their first ever series win on Australian soil.

					Hartley captained England to a successive Six Nations title in 2017, alongside fellow Saints Courtney Lawes, Teimana Harrison and Tom Wood, and is currently leading a young squad out in Argentina.

				 	Over the course of the past two seasons Mike Haywood has quickly shown that he is far more than a young stand-in for the experienced Dylan Hartley in the Saints front row.

					He has played a major part in some of the club's biggest wins in recent times, including starting the 2014 Aviva Premiership and European Challenge Cup finals, the epic Aviva Premiership semi-final win over Leicester, and the win at Ravenhill that ended Ulster's long-time European Cup home record.

					Born in Southend, Haywood was a product of the Saints Academy, and made his way into the Wanderers team during the 2010/11 season. Haywood then signed a first team contract in 2011 and he has gone from strength to strength, with his line out throwing coming on leaps and bounds. 

					In addition to domestic and European success with the Saints, Haywood has also experienced success internationally. The dynamic and tenacious front row was a member of the 2011 England Under-20 squad that secured five wins en route to a Six Nations Grand Slam, starting four of their matches. He was also involved in the IRB Junior World Championship later that year as England reached the final.

					In the summer of 2016 Haywood was named in the BT Sport Aviva Premiership Dream Team after a string of impressive performances in the 2015/16 season.

					The hooker became Saints' top try scorer in the 2016/17 season, scoring eight tries in 29 appearances that year.

					 	Local boy Courtney Lawes was raised just a stone's throw from Franklin's Gardens and has progressed to a level where he is now indispensable to the Saints. He has also proved invaluable to England too having taken responsibility of running his country’s lineout.

						Lawes was a member of the Saints Academy and made his first team debut in 2007 against Esher in National One.

						After the Saints were promoted back to the Premiership, Lawes continued to impress during the 2008/09 season in both the Guinness Premiership and Challenge Cup, receiving the Man of the Match award in the home game against Montpellier.

					 	The past 12 months have seen Harry Mallinder go from relative unknown to a star of the Saints first team. Since making the move into full-time rugby after completing his studies at Rugby School, where he captained the first team, Mallinder has proved himself to be a real talent across the Saints back line.

						A product of the Saints Academy, Sale-born Mallinder made his first team debut during the 2014/15 season with his breakthrough coming during the 2015/16 campaign. His 78th minute try against Glasgow Warriors at Franklin’s Gardens in the European Champions Cup secured a late 19-15 victory for the Saints and since then he has become a regular in the starting XV at either centre or full back.

						Mallinder has also impressed on the international scene too, making his England Under-18 debut at centre against Scotland in March 2014, scoring two penalties and a conversion in a 28-6 victory. Mallinder captained England Under-18s to victory over Portugal in the FIRA/AER Championship the following month before helping his side take the European crown with victory over Ireland in the final.

						In May 2016, Mallinder was named in the England squad for the World Rugby Under-20 Championship taking place in Manchester. The fly-half went on to captain England from the pool stages through to the final, as England were crowned World Champions. In the final against Ireland Mallinder scored 23 points, including two tries, in a man-of-the-match performance.

						Becoming a solid contender in the first team at centre over the 2016/17 season, Mallinder showed his maturity throughout the season but most notably as he kicked over the winning conversion to secure Saints European Champions Cup rugby for the 2017/18 season against State Francais.

						Mallinder's performances earned him England recognition and the young back is currently in Argentina with the national side for their summer tour, alongside fellow Saints Dylan Hartley, Piers Francis and Jamal Ford-Robinson.

				 	Despite only being 24 years old, George North has established himself as one of the world’s best wingers. King's Lynn-born North moved to Wales at the age of two and marked his Test debut for Wales by scoring two tries in a narrow 29-25 defeat to then World Champions South Africa in Cardiff. These tries made him the youngest Welshman to score on his debut.

					North's professional career started with Llandovery in 2010, a feeder club for Scarlets whom he joined 2010. During his three years with Scarlets, North scored 14 tries for the West Wales region before joining the Saints in the summer of 2013.

					His first season at the Saints ended with him helping the side win both the European Challenge Cup and the Aviva Premiership scoring seven tries in 15 Premiership appearances.

					Since exploding onto the international scene in 2010, North has amassed 60 caps, cementing his place in the starting XV. In addition to this, he has won three caps for the British and Irish Lions, scoring crucial tries in the first and third Tests as the Lions earned an historic Test series victory in 2013. 

					North has broken multiple records. He became the first teenager to reach 10 Test tries, and had played 21 times for Wales before turning 20. His tries at the 2011 Rugby World Cup made him the youngest try scorer at a World Cup as Wales reached the semi-finals for the first time in over 20 years.

					Post-World Cup, North played a crucial role as Wales won the Grand Slam in 2012 and defended their title the following year. A regular in the Wales side, North also represented his country at the 2015 Rugby World Cup with Wales making the quarter finals. He then went on to become top scorer in the 2016 Six Nations with four tries and was subsequently selected for Wales’ summer tour to New Zealand.

					Featuring in Wales' Six Nations squad for the 2017 campaign, North's performances in the Aviva Premiership earned him the call-up to the British and Irish Lions squad for their New Zealand tour, making his first start against the Crusaders in a warm-up game.
